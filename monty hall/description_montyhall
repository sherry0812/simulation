Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of N boxes: 

Inside one box is a car key; inside the others, empty. 
You pick a box, say No. 1, 
and the host, who knows what's inside the boxes, 
opens N-2 doors, which will have nothing.

He then says to you, "Do you want to switch with the remaining door?" 

Do you stick with (original guess) or switch to the unopened box? Does it matter?
